The system is a peer to peer chat program that will save the message history
of all users who have joined the chat and send them to a different directory for
evidence of someone having a bad sentiment in the chat.

To create a peer to peer chat:
./p2pchat <username>

To join an existing peer to peer chat:
./p2pchat <username> <name-of-machine-you-want-to-connect-to> <port-number>

The peers are monitored through polls, and messages are sent through parallell threads.

The chat histories are all written when one receives a message or sends a message client side.
The sentiment calculations are also done client side.

As long as the user does not terminate the session in an unusual way (i.e. not exiting with ":q" or ":quit")
the .txt file for storing the chat history which is stord in "ChatRecords"should be deleted.

If the user says too many bad things, the chat will forcefully terminate for the user and move the 
chat history of the user in question to the kickRecords directory.
